Like all regression analyses, the logistic regression is a predictive analysis. It is a statistical
method for analysing a dataset in which there are one or more independent variables that
determine an outcome. The outcome is measured with a binary variable.
We are using logistic regression to estimate the probability of a binary response based on multiple
features (or independent variables) and predict risk of a particular heart disease.
